| 21 | 🔄 Not Understanding the Execution Context (PL/SQL vs SQL Engine) | Writing SQL inside loops or procedural code without understanding when context switching occurs. | Huge performance bottlenecks due to excessive SQL calls from PL/SQL. 🛠️ Fix: Learn how SQL and PL/SQL engines interact. Use bulk operations (e.g., BULK COLLECT, FORALL) when dealing with large datasets. |
| 22  | 🔒 Hardcoding Values                                                     | Poor maintainability and reusability.                                       | Use constants or config tables. Example: `c_active_status CONSTANT VARCHAR2(1) := 'A';`                             |
| 23  | ⚠️ Poor Exception Handling                                               | Silent failures, hard-to-debug issues, data corruption.                     | Use specific exception handling. Example: `WHEN OTHERS THEN log_error(SQLCODE, SQLERRM); RAISE;`                    |
| 24  | 🐢 Ignoring Performance (Even in Simple Code)                            | Poor-performing apps from day one.                                          | Favor set-based logic. Example: `UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department_id = 10;`               |
| 25  | 🛡️ Not Using Bind Variables in Dynamic SQL                              | SQL injection, poor performance due to parsing.                             | Always use bind variables. Example: `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'UPDATE emp SET sal = :1 WHERE empno = :2' USING v_sal, v_empno;` |
| 26  | 🌀 Poor Use of Cursors                                                   | Memory leaks, complexity.                                                   | Use implicit cursors unless explicit ones are needed. Always close explicit cursors.                                |

| 31 | 📝 Lack of Documentation or Comments                                     | No one understands what you did.                                            | Use inline comments, and document procedure parameters and logic.                                                   |
| 32 | 🛠️ Not Learning the Oracle Tooling (SQL Developer, Toad, etc.)          | Slow development, debugging hell.                                           | Learn to use SQL Developer, TOAD, and their features (debugger, explain plan, etc.).                               |
| 33 | 📥 Using SELECT INTO Without Handling NO_DATA_FOUND                      | Runtime exceptions.                                                         | Always handle NO_DATA_FOUND in SELECT INTO.                                                                         |
| 34 | 🗑️ Writing Dead Code (Unused Variables/Procedures)                      | Cluttered codebase, confusion, and maintainability issues.                  | Regularly refactor and clean your code. Use tools to detect dead code.                                              |
| 35 | 🧐 Not Validating Input Parameters                                       | Invalid data entry, broken business rules.                                  | Always validate incoming inputs before using them in DML or logic.                                                  |
| 36 | 🏷️ Poor Naming Conventions                                               | Confusing code, low readability.                                            | Use meaningful, consistent naming (e.g., v_employee_name, p_salary, get_bonus_amount).                              |
| 37 | 📦 Inadequate Use of Packages                                            | Scattered code, namespace clutter.                                          | Organize related procedures/functions into packages.                                                                |

| 41 | 🚨 Overusing Exceptions as Logic                                         | Inefficient code and bad design.                                            | Use existence checks instead of exceptions for control flow.                                                        |
| 42 | 🚫 Not Checking for Null Values                                          | Incorrect logic, runtime errors.                                            | Always check for NULLs before using variables/columns.                                                              |
| 43 | 🗂️ No Version Control or Change Tracking                                 | Code loss, blame games, production bugs.                                    | Use Git or any VCS, and always test in dev/staging before production deployment.                                    |
| 44 | ➕ Using NVL() Where COALESCE() is Better                                | Incorrect results when expressions are evaluated.                           | Use COALESCE() when evaluating multiple nullable values.                                                            |
| 45 | ⏱️ Not Profiling or Measuring Performance                                | Bottlenecks in live systems.                                                | Use DBMS_PROFILER, DBMS_SQLTUNE, or manual timers (SYSTIMESTAMP) to analyze performance.                            |
